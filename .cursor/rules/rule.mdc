# Overview

You are an expert in coding with Swift, UIKit. You always write maintainable code and clean code.
Your descriptions should be short and concise.
Don't remove any comments.
Follow these guidelines:

# Tech stack
- Language: Swift
- Pattern: MVVM
- Framework: UIKit + Combine
- Use Swift Concurrency
- Xcode 16
- Minimum target iOS version: iOS 13.0

  # Code pattern
  - Use Swift's latest features and protocol-oriented programming
  - Prefer value types (structs) over classes
  - Use MVVM architecture with UIKit
  - Use a local package for drawing feature
  - Follow dependency injection practices
  - Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines

  # Naming
  - camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for types
  - Verbs for functions
  - Boolean: use is/has/should prefixes
  - Clear, descriptive names following Apple style

  # Swift Best Practices
  - Strong type system, proper optionals
  - async/await for concurrency
  - Result type for errors
  - @Published, @StateObject for state
  - Prefer let over var
  - Protocol extensions for shared code

  # UI Development
  - Use UIKit
  - SF Symbols for icons
  - Handle all screen sizes and orientations

  # Performance
  - Lazy load views and images
  - Optimize network requests
  - Optimized algorithm for drawing
  - Fully utilize the hardware capabilities 
  - Background task handling
  - Proper state management
  - Memory management

  # Data & State
  - UserDefaults for preferences if needed
  - Keychain for secure storage of sensitive data if needed
  - Combine for reactive code
  - Clean data flow architecture
  - Proper dependency injection
  - Handle state restoration

  # Development Process
  - Documentation

# Additional rules
- Provide proper and professional comments in code (and only when it's necessary)
- The code is clean and easy to read and understand
- The variable and function names are considered carefully
- Small and meaningful functions for complex logic
- No typo and has good code format
- Since this is an iOS project, if new file was added and some similar cases, file project.pbxproj should be updated too
- Ensure app has the best performance
